#for development no need to copy the application folders into the image because we are mounting this folder as a host mounted volume in the container. but we need to install nodemon
#but for production we need to still to copy it and not install nodemon to keep the container light.
#and run npm install from Weather-Api-AsyncAwait folder. we can create 2 Dockerfiles; one for production (Dockerfile calling: npm start) and one for Dev (Dockerfile_dev calling: npm test)
#[to be tested] or we can create a unique Dockerfile calling a build variable that will be passed at the moment of the image build using: --build-arg MODE=test
##ARG MODE="start"
##CMD ["${MODE}"]
